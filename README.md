# simpleconnect
Microservice that connects provider and consumer based on interest, very simple. 

<b>Lookups </b> - interest <br>
<b>Providers </b> - someone who owns that interest <br>
<b>Consumers </b> - someone who loved that interest.

<br>
<b>Idea</b> is to get rid of filling many field information to match, instead taking what best explains you/situtation/anything. 

Sounds simple ? yes, we will start with even very simple and then make it simple.
